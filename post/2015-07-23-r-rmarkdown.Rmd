# R Markdown

This is known as a 'R Markdown' document. It's a useful formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. I particularly like the [R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) from the RStudio team.  

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

You can also include code inline by surrounding the code with backticks, which looks `#like this`.
